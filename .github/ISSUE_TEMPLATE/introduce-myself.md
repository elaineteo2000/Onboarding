So for starters, let's create an issue to introduce yourself! This is informal and totally for fun so don't feel like you have to write us a CV 😉


*(PS: this will become public information, so don't spill out any secret or too embarassing anecdotes)* 😬

You can tell us anything you want about yourself, including answering the questions below. Best is to remove all of this pre-written text, and just leave the questions and your answers :relaxed:

----
